# Matplotlib


In this section, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to create plots. Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. It is widely used to visualize data and is very useful for data analysis and machine learning.


##  Installation and Setup


To install Matplotlib, you can use pip, a package manager for Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

To verify that Matplotlib is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip show matplotlib
```

To use Matplotlib, you need to import it. You can import it using the following command:

```python 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Bare in mind that in some jupyter notebooks, you may need to use the following command to display the plots:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```


## Creating a Plot


In this section we will see how to create a simple plot using Matplotlib. We will create a simple line plot using the `plot` function. The `plot` function takes two arguments, the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis is the independent variable and the y-axis is the dependent variable. The `plot` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y) # Create a line plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/plot.png
---
name: Output of the plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the plot
```
We can also produce a scatter plot using the `scatter` function. The `scatter` function takes two arguments, the x-axis and the y-axis. The `scatter` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.scatter(x, y) # Create a scatter plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/scatter.png
---
name: Output of the scatter plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the scatter plot
```

We can also draw 3D plots using the `plot` function. The `plot` function takes three arguments, the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis. The `plot` function will plot the z-axis against the x-axis and the y-axis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)
# This part is necessary to create the 3D plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d') # Create a 3D axis, 111 means 1x1 grid, first subplot, projection='3d' means 3D plot

x = np.random.standard_normal(100) # Create random data
y = np.random.standard_normal(100) # Create random data
z = np.random.standard_normal(100) # Create random data

ax.scatter(x, y, z) # Create a 3D scatter plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/3d.png
---
name: Output of the 3D plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the 3D plot
```


Also, we can produce a bar plot using the `bar` function. The `bar` function takes two arguments, the x-axis and the y-axis. The `bar` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.bar(x, y) # Create a bar plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/bar.png
---
name: Output of the bar plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the bar plot
```

Finally, we can produce a histogram using the `hist` function. The `hist` function takes one argument, the data. The `hist` function will plot the frequency of the data.

```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(1000) # Create random data

plt.hist(data, bins=30) # Create a histogram with 30 bins. Here bins are the number of intervals in the data, and it is a parameter of the histogram
                        # if bins is too small, the histogram will be too smooth, and if bins is too large, the histogram will be too spiky

plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/hist.png
---
name: Output of the histogram
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the histogram
```

This kind of plot is useful to visualize the distribution of the data.



##   Customizing the Plot



In this section we will see how to customize the plot using Matplotlib. We will see how to add a title, labels, and a legend to the plot. Also, we will see how to change the color, the line style, and the marker style of the plot.


###   Adding a Title


To add a title to the plot, you can use the `title` function. The `title` function takes one argument, the title of the plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y) # Create a line plot
plt.title('Simple Line Plot') # Add a title to the plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/title.png
---
name: Output of the title
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the title
```


###  Adding Labels


To add labels to the x-axis and y-axis, you can use the `xlabel` and `ylabel` functions. The `xlabel` and `ylabel` functions take one argument, the label of the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/labels.png
---
name: Output of the labels
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the labels
```


###  Adding a Legend


To add a legend to the plot, you can use the `legend` function. The `legend` function takes one argument, the label of the plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y, label='Line 1')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/legend.png
---
name: Output of the legend
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the legend
```


###  Changing the Color, Line Style, and Marker Style


To change the color, the line style, and the marker style of the plot, you can use the `color`, `linestyle`, and `marker` arguments of the `plot` function, respectively.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y, color='red', linestyle='--', marker='o')

plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/custom.png
---
name: Output of the custom
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the custom
```

## Multiple Plots

### Raw version

In matplotlib, you can create multiple plots in the same figure using the `subplot` function. The `subplot` function takes three arguments, the number of rows, the number of columns, and the index of the plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(x, y)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.scatter(x, y)

plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/multiple.png
---
name: Output of the multiple plots
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the multiple plots
```

### Formatted version
One of the best ways of creating multiple plots is using `fig` and `ax` objects. This way, you can create a figure and multiple axes, and then plot in each axis. 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure and 2 axes. Note that figsize is the size of the figure
ax[0].plot(x, y, label='Line 1') # Plot in the first axis, and add a label
ax[0].set_title('Line Plot') # We can also add a title to the plot
# We can also add labels to the x-axis and y-axis
ax[0].set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax[0].set_ylabel('Y-axis')
# We can also change the color, the line style, and the marker style of the plot
ax[0].plot(y, x, color='red', linestyle='dashdot', marker='x', label='Line 2')
# We can also add a legend to the plot
ax[0].legend(['Line 1', 'Line 2'])

ax[1].scatter(x, y, label='Scatter 1') # Plot in the second axis
ax[1].set_title('Scatter Plot')
ax[1].set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Y-axis')
ax[1].scatter(y, x, color='green', marker='o', label='Scatter 2')
ax[1].legend(['Scatter 1', 'Scatter 2'])
plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/multiple2.png
---
name: Output of the multiple plots
width: 700px
align: center
height: 350px
---
Output of the multiple plots
```

As you can see, the `fig` and `ax` objects are very useful to create multiple plots in the same figure. Note that this plot was more customized than the previous one. So, do not hesitate to use the `fig` and `ax` objects to create your plots, and visit the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) to learn more about the customization of the plots.

Before we leave this section, we will see how to save the plots to a file. You can use the `savefig` function to save the plots to a file. The `savefig` function takes one argument, the name of the file.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig('plot.png')
```

The example saves the plot to a file called `plot.png`.

## Seaborn and Matplotlib, a perfect combination

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is very useful to visualize complex data, and it is widely used in data analysis and machine learning.

### Installation and Setup

To install Seaborn, you can use pip, a package manager for Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install seaborn
```

To verify that Seaborn is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip show seaborn
```

To use Seaborn, you need to import it. You can import it using the following command:

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

### Creating a Plot

In this section we will see how to create a simple plot using Seaborn. We will create a simple line plot using the `lineplot` function. The `lineplot` function takes two arguments, the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis is the independent variable and the y-axis is the dependent variable. The `lineplot` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y, label='Line 1', color='red', linestyle='--') # Create a line plot
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/seaborn.png
---
name: Output of the Seaborn plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the Seaborn plot
```

Also, bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms can be created using Seaborn. The `barplot`, `scatterplot`, and `histplot` functions take two arguments, the x-axis and the y-axis. The `barplot` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis, the `scatterplot` function will plot the y-axis against the x-axis, and the `histplot` function will plot the frequency of the data.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
sns.barplot(x=x, y=y, color='blue', alpha=0.9, linewidth=2, edgecolor='black', capsize=0.2) # Create a bar plot, and customize it (color, transparency, linewidth, edgecolor, capsize)
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/seaborn2.png
---
name: Output of the Seaborn bar plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the Seaborn bar plot
```

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
sns.scatterplot(x=x, y=y, color='green', marker='o', s=100, edgecolor='black', linewidth=2) # Create a scatter plot, and customize it (color, marker, size, edgecolor, linewidth)

plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/seaborn3.png
---
name: Output of the Seaborn scatter plot
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the Seaborn scatter plot
```

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(1000) # Create random data

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure with a size of 10x5, width x height
sns.histplot(data, bins=30, kde=True, color='orange', edgecolor='black', linewidth=2) # Create a histogram with 30 bins, and customize it (color, kde, edgecolor, linewidth)
plt.show() # Show the plot
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/seaborn4.png
---
name: Output of the Seaborn histogram
width: 700px
align: center
height: 500px
---
Output of the Seaborn histogram
```

### Multiple Plots

In Seaborn, you can create multiple plots in the same figure using the `subplots` function. The `subplots` function takes two arguments, the number of rows and the number of columns.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5)) # Create a figure and 2 axes. Note that figsize is the size of the figure
sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y, label='Line 1', color='red', linestyle='--', ax=ax[0]) # Plot in the first axis, and add a label
ax[0].set_title('Line Plot') # We can also add a title to the plot
# We can also add labels to the x-axis and y-axis
ax[0].set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax[0].set_ylabel('Y-axis')
# We can also change the color, the line style, and the marker style of the plot
sns.lineplot(y, x, color='blue', linestyle='dashdot', ax=ax[0], label='Line 2')
# We can also add a legend to the plot
ax[0].legend(['Line 1', 'Line 2'])

sns.scatterplot(x=x, y=y, color='green', marker='o', ax=ax[1], label='Scatter 1') # Plot in the second axis
ax[1].set_title('Scatter Plot')
ax[1].set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax[1].set_ylabel('Y-axis')
sns.scatterplot(y, x, color='orange', marker='x', ax=ax[1], label='Scatter 2')
ax[1].legend(['Scatter 1', 'Scatter 2'])
plt.show()
```

The example gives as a output:

```{figure} ./images/practices/seaborn5.png
---
name: Output of the Seaborn multiple plots
width: 700px
align: center
height: 350px
---
Output of the Seaborn multiple plots
```

As you can see, Seaborn is very useful to visualize complex data, and it is widely used in data analysis and machine learning. Do not hesitate to use Seaborn to visualize your data, and visit the [Seaborn documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to learn more about the customization of the plots.
