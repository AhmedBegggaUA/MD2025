# The Project
The **Discrete Brain** is an educational initiative oriented to explore the interconnection between discrete and continuous maths for inspiring algorithms and even to *neuralize* them. The long-term objective is to foster a principled development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

In our opinion, the AI-Engineer (AIE) should master discrete maths, including probability as a bridge to heuristic solvers of NP-hard problems. Herein, in **Distrinite Mathematics** (Discrete maths for AI) we will set the basis of alogithmic exploration. 

**Graphs** play a fundamental role in this subject. The basic idea is that the human brain is a graph itself, a network of connected neurons with paths, trees and subgraphs created by evolution. As the brain is the support of information flow, graphs can be explored by launching random walks. 

**Real cases**. A key element of the Discrete Brain is to illustrate the working of algorithms on realistic cases such as the characterization of social networks and brain networks. It is not only a matter of obtaining some statistics of these networks, as it happens in network science. We go beyond this: we want to understand their structure, diffuse information to label unknown nodes from known ones, compute distances between nodes, etc. 

**Future**. This is the first subject of the Discrete Brain initiative. It will be followed by **Heursitic Search** and hopefully by others. We will be delighted to tutorize research projects oriented to build intelligent networks such as Graph-Neural Networks. 

**Team**. The creative team of this project is composed by professors and PhD students with a strong knowledge of the state-of-the-art of structural methods in AI.

- **Ahmed Begga**. PhD student and expert in Graph-Neural Networks.
